Welcome!

I'm a student of Brigham Young University. I spend my free time thinking about economics, psychology, statistics, strategy, finance, technology, organizational behavior, impact investing, philosophy, society, etc. I'm currently learning Python and R for strategy analytics purposes.

You can find me on LinkedIn, Twitter, or on Substack.

Thanks for being here,

Garret
