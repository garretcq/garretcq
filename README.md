Hey, I'm Garret.

I'm interested in economics, statistics, data science, decentralized finance, NFTS, and web development (specifically in web 3.0). I'm currently learning C++ and Python via Codecademy.com and am using Github as a location to practice projects. I'm pursuing a degree in statistics and psychology.

You'll catch me on twitter @_socialventures. Feel free to reach out!

Talk soon.

Garret
