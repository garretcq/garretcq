Hey, I'm Garret.

I'm interested in economics, statistics, data science, decentralized finance, NFTS, and web development (specifically in web 3.0). I'm currently learning C++ and Python via and am using Github and Replit as practice hubs. I'm pursuing a degree in economics/math/psychology

You'll catch me on twitter, linkedin, and here. Feel free to reach out!

Talk soon, and good luck.
