Hey, I'm Garret.

I'm interested in economics, statistics, data science, decentralized finance, blockchain, and impact investing. I've worked with a variety of social ventures and launched my university's impact investing association. I'm currently pursuing a degree in economics/strategy, and using Github and Replit to practice coding.

You'll catch me on Twitter, Linkedin. Feel free to reach out!

Talk soon, and good luck.
