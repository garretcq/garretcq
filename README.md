Hey, I'm Garret.

I'm interested in economics, statistics, data science, decentralized finance, and blockchain. I'm currently learning C++ and Python via and am using Github and Replit as practice hubs. I'm pursuing a degree in economics.

You'll catch me on Twitter, Linkedin. Feel free to reach out!

Talk soon, and good luck.
